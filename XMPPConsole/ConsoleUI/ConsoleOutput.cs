    /// pure output does not: <b>the user is typing right now.</b> Whoever
    /// writes in between takes their half-finished line apart and leaves them
    /// without a prompt.
    ///
    /// The event handling has taken that into account from the start and
    /// bracketed every output by hand in "erase the line ... write the prompt
    /// again" - eleven times the same two lines. <b>The logger did not take it
    /// into account</b>, for it knew nothing of all this: an
    /// <c>AddSimpleConsole</c> writes whenever it suits it.
    ///
    /// Here both run together, and under <b>one lock</b>. That is the second,
    /// less visible part: the events come from the receiving thread, the log
    /// from any thread at all, and two simultaneous outputs otherwise
    /// interleave in the middle of a word - together with the colour the one
    /// set and the other put back.
